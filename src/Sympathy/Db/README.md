Models and Data Access Object wrappers for Doctrine DBAL
========================================================

**Models** (also called "Business Models" or "Business Objects") are logically located between **Controllers** - which render views and validate user input - and **Data Access Objects** (DAOs), that are low-level interfaces to a storage backend or Web service.

Public interfaces of models are high-level and should reflect all use cases within their domain. There is a number of standard use-cases (CRUD - create, read, update, delete) that are pre-implemented in the base class `Sympathy\Db\Model`:
- `factory ($name = '', Dao $dao = null)`: Create a new model instance
- `find ($id)`: Find a record by primary key
- `reload ()`: Reload values from database
- `findAll (array $cond = array(), $wrapResult = true)`: Find multiple records; if `$wrapResult` is false, plain DAOs are returned instead of model instances
- `search (array $cond, array $options = array())`: Perform a search ($options can contain count, offset and/or sort order; the return value array also contains count, offset, sort order plus the total number of results; see DAO documentation)
- `searchAll (array $cond = array(), $order = false)`: Simple version of search(), similar to findAll()
- `searchOne (array $cond = array())`: Search a single record; throws an exception if 0 or more than one record are found
- `searchIds (array $cond, array $options = array())`: Returns an array of matching primary keys for the given search condition
- `getModelName ()`: Returns the model name without prefix and postfix
- `getId ()`: Returns the ID of the currently loaded record (throws exception, if empty)
- `hasId ()`: Returns true, if the model instance has an ID assigned (primary key)
- `getValues ()`: Returns all model properties as associative array
- `getEntityTitle ()`: Returns the common name of this entity
- `isDeletable ()`: Returns true, if the model instance can be deleted
- `batchEdit (array $ids, array $properties)`: Update data for multiple records
- `getTableName ()`: Returns the name of the associated main database table
- `hasTimestampEnabled ()`: Returns true, if timestamps are enabled for the associated DAO
- `delete ()`: Permanently delete the entity record from the database
- `update(array $values)`: Update existing entity; before assigning multiple values to a model instance, data should be validated using a form class
- `create(array $values)`: Create a new record using the values provided

**How much validation should be implemented within a model?** Wherever invalid data can lead to security issues or major inconsistencies, some core validation rules must be implemented in the model layer. Model exception messages usually donâ€™t require translation (in multilingual applications), since invalid values should be recognized beforehand by a form class. If you expect certain exceptions, you should catch and handle them in your controllers.
